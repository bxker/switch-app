## What is Switch?
Switch is a psuedo-Twitch clone that is geared towards developers. To get started, a user can sign-up via the sign-up page. From there, the user can update their Twitch username and stream title. This will allow Switch to connect the users profile with their Twitch account to display if they are live, and to show their Twitch player on their profile. From there, the user can stream to their Twitch account, as they normally would. Their profile will show as live to other users on the Browse page, along with a live indicator. Other users can then go to the user's profile and watch the stream and communicate via the chat box. If you are curious about Switch, and you don't want to create an account, try logging in with the demo account details listed above!
